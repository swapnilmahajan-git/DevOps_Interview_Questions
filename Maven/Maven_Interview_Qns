INTERVIEW QUESTION:
=====================
1.) What are the differences between ANT and Maven.

	- Refer antVsmaven difference file.

2.) How do you create a jar/war file in Maven?
	
	- mvn install

3.)What is the  difference between mvn deploy and install?
	
	- mvn install 
		- mvn install command is used for compiles the code.
		- copy built artifacts i.e jar/war file into local repository $USER_HOME/.m2
	- mvn deploy
		- copy built artifacts i.e jar/war file into remote repository like nexus.

4.)Can you explain Maven's lifecycle? [Give one line explanation about each phase during your interview]
		- validate :- validate project's structure		
		- init :- prepares project with initial pre-requisites ex: setting properties, creating necessary directory structure..etc.
		- compile :- compiles "main" java code.
		- test-compile :- compiles "test" java code
		- test :- Runs the test cases and generates test reports.
		- package :- creates jar/war.
		- install :- copy jar/war from target to .m2 repository
	

5.)What is Maven? Why we use Maven?
	
	-Maven
	    - Maven is a build tool used to build deployable artifacts from source code.

	-Why we use Maven
	     1.)When you use Maven, you describe your project using a well-defined project object model(ie.POM.xml)
	     2.)Maven has a a set of standards, a project lifecycle, a dependency management system.
	     3.)Maven can apply cross-cutting logic from a set of shared (or custom) plugins.

6.)While building the project, you get an error saying some jar file is missing. how do you add that?
	
	- we can add dependency in POM.xml file.

7.)What is groupId, artifactId, and Version in Maven?

	- groupId- this is package name.
	- artifactId- this is project name.
	- Version- this is project version.

8.)What are the Maven co-ordinates?
	
	-groupId, artifactId, and Version these are Maven co-ordinates. 
	
9.)What are the mandatory attributes in pom.xml?

	- groupId, artifactId, and Version these are mandatory attributes in pom.xml

10.)What is the difference between 1.0-SNAPSHOT(SNAPSHOT) version and 1.0-RELEASE(RELEASE) version.

	- In case of Version, if Maven once downloaded the mentioned version say data-service:1.0, it will never try to download a newer 1.0 available in repository. 
	  To download the updated code, data service version is be upgraded to 1.1.

	 - In case of SNAPSHOT, Maven will automatically fetch the latest SNAPSHOT (data-service:1.0-SNAPSHOT) everytime app-ui team build their project.


11.)What is the default naming convention of an artifacts(jar/war) in Maven?

	- artifactId-version.jar/war (FOR EX. gamutkart-1.1-SNAPSHOT.war)


12.)How do you generate a site in Maven?

	-  mvn site	

13.)How do you run a clean build in Maven?
	
	- mvn clean

14.)how do you add a dependency in Maven pom.xml?
	
	1.) go to pom.xml file
	2.) go to dependencies tag and add dependency in dependencies tag
	
	
14.)what is a plugin?

	- a plugin execution framework where every task is actually done by plugins.
	- A plugin generally provides a set of goals, which can be executed using the following syntax −

		-$ mvn [plugin-name]:[goal-name] (Ex. mvn compiler:compile)

15.)What is the default path of artifacts in local repository?

	- $USER_HOME/.m2/repository/groupId/artifactId/version/jar_war_file_name


16.)Where maven stores the built artifacts? 

	- $USER_HOME/.m2/repository/groupId/artifactId/version

	
17.)How do you create a project in the Maven?
	
	-Two ways we can create a maven project
	    1.) Web-App
		$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.flipkart -DartifactId=flipkart -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
	    2.) Standalone
		$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.flipkart -DartifactId=flipkart -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false
	

18.)What are the different binary repositoris we have? Which one you are using for your project?

	- Central
	- Private/Remote (Nexus/atifactrory)
	- Local (.m2)


19.)How do you customize the name of your artifact(jar/war) in Maven?
				OR
    How do you change the name of built jar/war file in maven? what changes you need to do in pom.xml file?

	- 1.) go to pom.xml file.
	  2.) give some required name in build tag, see below example:
		<build>
			<finalName>gamutkart</finalName>
		</build>
	  (note:- Only in target folder nameing convention is change not in .m2 folder)


20.)What do you mean by transitive dependency in Maven and can you explain how maven resolves it?

	- What do you mean by transitive dependency
		- Transitive dependency means to avoid needing to discover and specify the libraries that your own dependencies require, and including them automatically.
	
	- can you explain how maven resolves it
		It means to directly specify the versions of artifacts(project-name) to be used when they are encountered in transitive dependencies. 
		For an example project C can include project B artifac15.)What is the default path of artifacts in local repository?ts as a dependency in its dependency Management section and directly control which version of B is to be used.

	
21.)What is the significance/importance of scope parameter in dependency section?

	- The <scope> element can take 6 values: compile, provided, runtime, test, system and import.
	- This scope is used to limit the transitivity of a dependency, and also to affect the classpath used for various build tasks.

	
22.)What are the different scope's we have in Maven?
	
	-The <scope> element can take 6 values: 
		- compile, 
		- provided, 
		- runtime, 
		- test, 
		- system, 
		- import.
