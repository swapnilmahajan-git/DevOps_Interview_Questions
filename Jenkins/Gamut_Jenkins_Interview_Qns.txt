===============================================

1.) What is continuos integration C.I.? & Continuous Delivery C.D?

	- C.I integration is nothing but continous compilation, testing and deployment.
	- C.I is a process which monitors the new changes coming into V.C.S like Git, checkouts the source code, builds the change, runs the test case to test the change and deploys it to given 		  environment automatically (seemlessly) without any manual intervention.
	
	- C.D depoloment extends continuous delivery so that the software build will automatically deploy if it passes all tests. In such a process, there is no need for a person to decide when and what 		  goes into production

2.) How do you change Jenkins HOME directory??

	Go to $USER_HOME/.bashrc and add below ENV variable.
		Note :- If we want copy .jenkins to other users that time we can set below command in .bashrc file (java environment variable) 

	export JENKINS_HOME=/home/USER/folderName/.jenkins

3.) How many ways for Jenkins installation?

	Approach:1
	----------
		1. download JDK
		2. download Tomcat
		3. download jenkins.war
		4. copy jenkins.war to $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps
			[deploying jenkins to tomcat]
		5. start Tomcat server using $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
		6. Launch Jenkins using below URL
					http://localhost:8080/jenkins	
		7. command to shutdown tomcat:
				$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

	Approach:2
	----------
	1. Running jenkins direclty from command line. 
	2. Not suitable for production jenkins.
	3. Jenkins.war comes with a light-weight server called "jetty". below command runs jenkins in jetty server.

	4. $ java -jar jenkins.war
	5. you can launch jenkins using below URL:
		http://localhost:8080

	Approach:3
	----------
		sudo apt-get install jenkins


4.) Why we need continous Integration?
	-C.I is a process which monitors the new changes coming into V.C.S like Git, checkouts the source code, builds the change, runs the test case to test the change and deploys it to given 
	 environment automatically (seemlessly) without any manual intervention.


5.) Have you created jenkins job or just worked on existing jenkins environment?
	- Yes we created new jobs and worked on existing jobs also.

	 
6.) How do you create a new build/jenkins job?
	
	1. Create New Item.
	2. Select Freestyle or Pipeline Project.
	3. Configure job with git repo url, maven execute shell or jenkinsfile.
	4. Apply & save.
	5. Build Now.


7.) How do you install jenkins? What are the different ways?
	1. java -jar jenkins.war  [http://localhost:8080] [uses jetty server]
	2. yum install jenkins[RHEL] OR apt-get install jenkins [Ubuntu]
	3. Deploy jenkins.war in tomcat like any other web applications. [Production approach]


8.) How do you setup a crontab in linux?
		Note: Refer Google and setup a simple crontab.
  	- creating a new crontab.	
	  	$ crontab -e (Edit your crontab file, or create one if it doesn't already exist.)
			====
			* * * * * `command/any-script`
			Minute   Hour	 DOM	 Month  DOW	
			0-59	 0-23	1-31	1-12	0-7
			====
 	- list all crontabs
		$ crontab -l (Display your crontab file.)

  	- remove all crontabs
		$ crontab -r 

	
9.) What is the difference between Poll SCM & build periodically in Jenkins?
	- Poll SCM periodically polls the SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) and builds the project if new commits where pushed since the last build, 
	- whereas build periodically builds the project periodically even if nothing has changed.


10.) How do you migrate jenkins from one server to another?
	 1.) Install Jenkins in the new machine.
	 2.) Copy .jenkins to new machine's $USER_HOME dir. (means copy .jenkins in /root).
	 3.) Start Tomcat and jenkins server in the new machine.
		- [ Note: Usually, we don't copy workspace from old jenkins server to new as it contains large size of source code.] so we need to compress the workspace using below command.
		- [command to exclude workspace.
			tar --exclude=workspace -cvf jenkins.tar .jenkins]


11.) How do you start/stop jenkins?
	- http://<jenkins.server>/exit
	- http://<jenkins.server>/safeExit
	- http://<jenkins.server>/restart
	

12.) Jenkins is running some jobs and I want to restart it. How do you restart? or How do you restart the jenkins without interrupting running jobs?
								      ----
	- http://<jenkins.server>/restart
	- http://<jenkins.server>/safeRestart


13.) What is the default port number of jenkins?
	- port -8080.

14.) How do you change the port number for Jenkins?
	1.) Go to $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml
	2.) Change port number in this line: [ port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" ] 


15.) How do you check Jenkins logs? or How do you check your Application logs?
				   ---
	- $TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.2017-08-08.log


16.) What challenges you faced while working with Jenkins? OR What are the common issues you see in Jenkins?

		- compilation
		- deployment
		- jdk or maven installation
		- disk space (Go to $USER_HOME/.bashrc and add below ENV variable. Note :- If we want copy .jenkins to other users that time we can set below command in .bashrc file (java environment 		 		variable) export JENKINS_HOME=/home/USER/folderName/.jenkins
		- port change


17.) Where does Jenkins store global and job related configurations?
	- Global configurations: $JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/config.xml (JENKINS_HOME directory means /root directory)
	  ---------------------
	- Job configurations: $JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/jobs/job_name/config.xml
	  -------------------


18.) Where Jenkins stores all plugins data?
	- $JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/plugins


19.) I want to modify JDK version from 1.7 to 1.8 in 1000 jobs? How do you do it?
	- Jenkins stores all configuration data in .jenkins/jobs/job_name/config.xml
	- we can find 1.7 in all config.xml and replace it with 1.8 using some linux command or small script.
	- Then to load the changes, we need to run "Reload configurations from disk".


20.) How do you setup build and deployment for your project?
	- configure GIT URL
	- configure maven build command i.e 'mvn install"
	- go to post build section and call deploy.sh
	
	Deployment scritpt steps:
		- before copying the war file, our script checks 
		  for diskspace.
		- copy war file to all tomcat servers in an environment(copy using scp)
		- shutdown the tomcat
		- start the tomcat

21.) How many builds you store in your jenkins?
	- 15 or 20 builds (if the builds no is increase we took backup of all builds using shlave project, the shlave folder created in .jenkins folder). 	
			  - give the desired path in the shlave plugin.

22.) How do you rotate logs for your Jenkins? 
	- 

23.) How do you backup your jenkins data?
	- ThinBackup


24.) How do you configure different jenkins jobs to run with different JDKs?
	-Refer 19. no question answer.

25.) How do you configure security for your jenkins? Are you using LDAP for authentication?
	-We are using Authentication
	  1.Manage Jenkins 
	  2.Configure global security
		|
	      Enable Security
	- ask nagesh

26.) What is matrix based security? How do you provide access to your users?
	1. Manage Jenkins --> Manage Users --> Create Users
	2. Managae Jenkins-->Cnfigure global security-->click Enable Security-->Click Matrix-based Security->give some access to based on requirment.


27.) What is a plugin? What plugins you installed? Name few plugins which you have used?
====
	1. Thin Backup -
		Using Cron tab style/notion, we can schedule the backups for jenkins. We usually take backup for Jenkins home directory. 
		Once we install this plugin, It adds "ThinBackup" section to "manage jenkins".


	3. Job Configuration History plugin:
		we can check job configuration history. for example-
		who deleted a job or configuration
		who modifed jdk version
		who modified build trigger schedule
		user addition/deletion..etc.
		Once we install this plugin, we can see who has done what or who made what changes. It records the history of all user's modifications.


	4. Shelve project:
	    	If we have large size of build log files, un-used jenkins jobs, Jenkins will become slow(as it has to scan all projects for generating reports). 
		So, It's good idea to archive any un-used jenkins jobs so that jenkins don't scan the project. since this plugin archives the projects, we can restore them if we want in the future.


	PLUGINS
	=============

	Test Results Analyzer 

	====

28.) What are the different ways of installing a plugin?
	- 

	
29.) What is "Reload configurations from the Disk"? when do you use this?
	- Whenever we are modifing jobs using config.xml, we need to restart the jenkins. so dont restart the jenkins, that time go to 
		1. Manage Jenkins --> click on Reload Configuration Disk.


30.) How do you take back up for only jobs? excluding WS?
	- Thinbackup


31.) How do you set up distributed builds?
	- using master/slave

32.) How many slave nodes you have?
 	-


33.) What is a label?
    	-Label is a virtual name for one or more slave nodes using which we can tie a particular jenkins job to always run on a pariticular machine (Usually which has jdk6 or jdk8 or windows
	 machine...etc.)


34.) what kind of problems you faced with your jenkins so far?
        - Our Master server became slow. So to distribute the load, I implemented master/slave concept and today our builds are running in 4 slave nodes.
        - Regular compile / deployment issues.
		- Diskspace issues.


35.) Suddenly my Jenkins instance became slow. What steps do you take to improve the performance?
		- clean up old jobs. may be by using shelve plugin
		- implement master/slave distributed concept.
		- may be improve the computing power for ex: RAM 	
			and CPU
		- Make sure your Master doesn't run any jobs. Just 
			keep it for serving jenkins trafic and schedule 
			all your builds in slave nodes.


36.) how much you rate yourself in jenknins?
	-

37.) Do you have experience with .Net builds?
	-

38.) How do you upgrade jenkins?
	- take a test machine
	- install the same old version of jenkins in the 
	  test machine.
	- copy .jenkins from old jenkins to test machine and bring the jenkins server up in test machine.
	- deploy the new war file to test machine.	
	- test few builds randomly in test Jenkins to see if everything works well as old jenkins.
	-  finally repeat the same steps in production/original 
		server.

39.) Can you name few Jenkins Features? 
	    - Jenkins is process improvment tool
	    - using jenkins we can compile, run tests, build the code and deploy efficiently by continuously integrating users changes with existing application.
	    - we can generate graps, statistics for our builds and test cases,
	    - jenkins provides fast feed back when some thing goes wrong.
	    - Jenkins is extensible coz it is plugin based and rich in features. 
	    - jenkins can act as a nice reporting tool. it sends test case and any other report in html format with some nice colors.
	    - helps to deliver the code to production very quickly with quality code by running the test cases.
	    - allows us to run builds in parellel. so builds can run faster.
	    - allows us to run different builds with different confiugrations seemlesly without much configuration complexity.


40.) How do you setup Jenkins from scratch?
	- 

41.) What are the prerequisites for Jenkins?
	- Tomcat
	- GIT
	- JAVA
	- MAVEN

42.) how do you deploy an application in tomcat?
			OR
     can you explain how the deployment happens for your project?
        - we build war file as a final artifact
        - we have shell script for deployment.
		- It checks if tomcat/target machine is up and 
			running and has enough free disk space
        - it does shutdown the server 
        - copies the war file to webapps location
        - starts the server.
		- It also sends the email notifications to all users

43.) What is the difference between web server and application server?
	-web server serves static content: ex..
		html
		images
		javascript
	-application server serves dynamic content:
		search results
		date conversion
		weather application

44.) What is parameterised build job? How do you set it up?

45.) What is build pipeline? have you created build pipelines?


46.)How do you set up the crontab?
		OR
    can you explain crontab syntax?
		OR
    how to create/remove crontabs?

	1.Create a new crontab:
		$ crontab -e

	2.List all crontabs available
		$ crontab -l

	3. Remove a crontab
		$ crontab -r

	4.Crontab Syntax:
		Min   Hour  DOM   Month  DOW
		0-59  0-23  1-31  1-12   0-7 

	ex:everyday at 12:00 am, Monday to Friday
		00 12 * * 1-5

47.)What is No. of executers in jenkins?

	- It is recommended to allocate executers to agent machines, rather than on the jenkins master to avoid potential security vulnerabilities, Out-Of-Memory and other performance issues. To do this, 		  configure the "# of executers" to '0' on the master, by default node is '2'.


# Jenkins with .NET framework
=============================
	- Git version control must be installed
	- .NET framework and the MSBuild app should be there
	- MSBuild extension in Jenkins must be installed
	- Anything else; such as the MSTest, which you can then use later on by yourself.


scp syntax:
===========
sshpass -p "gamut" scp gamutkart.war gamut@172.17.0.2:/home/gamut/Distros/apache-tomcat-8.5.11/webapps
